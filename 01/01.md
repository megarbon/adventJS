# Toy Factory Identification Number Checker

In the magical toy factory of the North Pole, each toy is assigned a unique identification number. However, due to an error in the toy machine, some identification numbers have been mistakenly assigned to more than one toy.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find the first identification number that has been repeated, where the second occurrence has the smallest index in the list.

## Problem Description

Implement a function `findFirstRepeated(giftIds)` that takes an array `giftIds` representing the identification numbers of toys and returns the first repeated number, considering the specified conditions. If no number is repeated, the function should return -1.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const giftIds = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2];
const firstRepeatedId = findFirstRepeated(giftIds);
console.log(firstRepeatedId); // Expected Output: 3
// Even though 2 and 3 are repeated
// 3 appears the second time first

const giftIds2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const firstRepeatedId2 = findFirstRepeated(giftIds2);
console.log(firstRepeatedId2); // Expected Output: -1
// It is -1 since no number is repeated

const giftIds3 = [5, 1, 5, 1];
const firstRepeatedId3 = findFirstRepeated(giftIds3);
console.log(firstRepeatedId3); // Expected Output: 5
```
