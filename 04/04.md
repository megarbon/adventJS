# Santa's Workshop Message Decoder

In ðŸŽ… Santa's workshop, some Christmas messages have been written in a peculiar way: the words within the brackets must be read backward.

Santa needs these messages to be correctly formatted. Your task is to write a function that takes a string and reverses the characters within each pair of parentheses, removing the parentheses as well. However, bear in mind that there may be nested parentheses, so you should reverse the characters in the correct order.

## Problem Description

Implement a function `decode(message)` that takes a string `message` and reverses the characters within each pair of parentheses, removing the parentheses as well. The input strings will always be well-formed with parentheses that match correctly, and there should not be any parentheses left in the final message. The maximum nesting level is 2.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const a = decode("hola (odnum)");
console.log(a); // Expected Output: hola mundo

const b = decode("(olleh) (dlrow)!");
console.log(b); // Expected Output: hello world!

const c = decode("sa(u(cla)atn)s");
console.log(c); // Expected Output: santaclaus
```
