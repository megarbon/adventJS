# Santa's Workshop Gift Manufacturing

In Santa's workshop, the elves have a gift list they wish to make and a limited set of materials. Gifts are strings of text, and materials are characters. Your task is to write a function that, given a list of gifts and the available materials, returns a list of the gifts that can be made.

## Problem Description

Implement a function `manufacture(gifts, materials)` that takes an array `gifts` representing the list of gifts and a string `materials` representing the available materials. The function should return an array containing the gifts that can be made using the provided materials.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const gifts1 = ["tren", "oso", "pelota"];
const materials1 = "tronesa";
const result1 = manufacture(gifts1, materials1);
console.log(result1); // Expected Output: ["tren", "oso"]

const gifts2 = ["juego", "puzzle"];
const materials2 = "jlepuz";
const result2 = manufacture(gifts2, materials2);
console.log(result2); // Expected Output: ["puzzle"]

const gifts3 = ["libro", "ps5"];
const materials3 = "psli";
const result3 = manufacture(gifts3, materials3);
console.log(result3); // Expected Output: []
```
