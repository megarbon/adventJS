# Santa's Workshop Manufacturing Analysis

In Santa's workshop, a mischievous elf has been playing around with the gift production line, adding or removing an unplanned step. You have the original sequence of manufacturing steps and the modified sequence that may include an extra step or be missing a step.

## Problem Description

Implement a function `findNaughtyStep(original, modified)` that takes two strings `original` and `modified`, representing the original and modified manufacturing sequences, respectively. The function should identify and return the first extra step that was added or removed in the manufacturing chain. If there is no difference between the sequences, the function should return an empty string.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const original1 = "abcd";
const modified1 = "abcde";
const naughtyStep1 = findNaughtyStep(original1, modified1);
console.log(naughtyStep1); // Expected Output: 'e'

const original2 = "stepfor";
const modified2 = "stepor";
const naughtyStep2 = findNaughtyStep(original2, modified2);
console.log(naughtyStep2); // Expected Output: 'f'

const original3 = "abcde";
const modified3 = "abcde";
const naughtyStep3 = findNaughtyStep(original3, modified3);
console.log(naughtyStep3); // Expected Output: ''
```
