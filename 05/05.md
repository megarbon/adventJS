# CyberReindeer Sled Simulator

Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer, on a North Pole road. The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

- `.` = Road
- `S` = Santa's Sled
- `*` = Open barrier
- `|` = Closed barrier

Each unit of time, the sled moves one position to the right. If it encounters a closed barrier, it stops until the barrier opens. If it is open, it goes through directly.

All barriers start closed, but after 5 units of time, they all open forever.

## Problem Description

Create a function `cyberReindeer(road, time)` that simulates the sled's movement for a given time and returns an array of strings representing the state of the road at each unit of time.

### Example Usage

```javascript
const road = "S..|...|..";
const time = 10; // units of time
const result = cyberReindeer(road, time);

// Expected Output:
/*
[
  'S..|...|..', // initial state
  '.S.|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '...S...*..', // barrier opens, sled advances
  '...*S..*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*.S.*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*..S*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*...S..', // passes through the open barrier
]
